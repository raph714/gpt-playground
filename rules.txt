Gameplay
Basics:
Game is for 2-5 players.
This is a deck building, competitive game that also requires some cooperation! Each player will have strengths based on cards in their deck and players must work together or the whole crew loses.

Game Setup:
Each player starts with the same 10 card deck consisting of five **Basic Distraction** cards and five **Basic Intimidation** cards.
Place the Detection marker at 0.
Each player shuffles, then  draws 5 cards from their respective decks.
Place the top 3 place cards into the map tray.
There are five person slots above the detection counter; each slot adds an effect when filled.
Roll a die to determine who goes first, then play proceeds clockwise for the rest of the game.
The body is disposed of automatically once all map cards have been played and resolved.

Turn Phases:
Player chooses one of the three map cards in the tray and places it on the board.
Resolve the effects on the chosen map card from top to bottom. Each item must be resolved before moving on to the next effect.
Active player has priority to resolve both map and people triggers. They get 3 actions per turn to play cards, but may give their actions to other players to help overcome challenges and share rewards.
At any point during the turn the active player may choose to deal with people in the detection counter.
Once all map card effects are resolved, trigger all detection counter effects, and pass turn to the next player.

Dealing with People
When a person is revealed, the active player has priority when dealing with that person. If they chose not to resolve any of the requirements, priority is passed to the next player to respond. They will get all the rewards listed on the card, but may agree with other players to split those rewards in some manner.
If a person is not dealt with, the card moves to the next open person slot in the detection counter. (left to right)

Ending The Game

If last map card is resolved, the body is disposed of, and the crew wins! If, on the other hand, the Detection marker reaches 10, the crew loses.
If the crew wins, the person with the most affiliation points when the body is disposed wins. Affiliation points are gained through the encounter deck, interaction with person cards, and through cards in each player’s deck.
